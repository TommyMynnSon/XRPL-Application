Basics of building an XRP Ledger-connected application in JavaScript using the `xrpl.js` client library in Node.js:
- Wallet generation
- Wallet funding using the Testnet faucet
- Wallet instantiation using a known seed encoded in base58
- Querying the XRP Ledger & handling responses
- Creating Handlers for events on the XRP Ledger
- Sending of XRP between wallets (Payment transaction)
- Creating offers (OfferCreate transaction)
- Creating trust lines (TrustSet transaction)
